# learning_data_science

A few projects completed while learning Data Science, mostly for educational purposes. Each Data Analysis project is available as a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file, in the Projects_Jupyter folder) and as an html file (in the html filder). 

The folder `Data` contains the data files, `C` contains C libraries used to speed-up some calculations, and `Python` contains Python codes not directly related to a particular Data Analysis project.
