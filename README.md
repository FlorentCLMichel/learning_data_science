# learning_data_science
A few projects completed while learning Data Science, mostly for educational purposes.

In the notebook Profitable_App_Profiles.ipynb I study the popularity of apps on the Apple App and Google Play stores as function of their genre, size, and content rating. 

In ExpHackerNews.ipynb, I study the popularity of “Ask HN” and “Show HN” posts on Hacker News to determine the best time to post them.

In ExpHackerNews.ipynb I study some properties of ads for cars sold on the German version of eBay.
