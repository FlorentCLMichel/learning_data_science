# learning_data_science

A few projects completed while learning Data Science, mostly for educational purposes. Each project is available as a Jupyter (.ipynb file) and as an html file. 

The folder Data contains the data files, and C contains C libraries.

In the notebook Wine_testing.ipynb, I set-up a Random Forest model to predict the quality of red wine from 11 parameters.

In the notebook Profitable_App_Profiles.ipynb I study the popularity of apps on the Apple App and Google Play stores as function of their genre, size, and content rating. 

In ExpHackerNews.ipynb, I study the popularity of “Ask HN” and “Show HN” posts on Hacker News to determine the best time to post them.

In ExpHackerNews.ipynb I study some properties of ads for cars sold on the German version of eBay (work in progress). 

In Earnings_college_major.ipynb, I study the median earnings and employment rates of college graduates in the USA (work in progress).
