    "# SMS spam filter using a naive Bayes algorithm <font style=\"color:rgb(0,100,200)\"> (Work in progress) </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build a simple Short Message Service (SMS) spam filter using a multinomial Bayes algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, the algorithm works in the following way. \n",
    "We start from a corpus of many text messages labeled as spam or non-spam. \n",
    "Let $N_s$ be the total number of words in spam messages and $N_{ns}$ the tota number of words in non-spam messages. \n",
    "Let $V$ be the size of the vocabulary, *i.e.*, the total number fof different words in the corpus. \n",
    "Let $\\alpha$ be a positive number (to be chosen once) called the smoothing parameter.\n",
    "For each word $w$, we denote by $N_{w|s}$ the number of times $w$ appears in spam messages and by $N_{w|ns}$ the number of times it appears in non-spam messages. \n",
    "We then define the two weights $p_{w|s}$ and $p_{w|ns}$ by: \n",
    "$$p_{w|s} = \\frac{N_{w|s} + \\alpha}{N_s + \\alpha V}$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$p_{w|ns} = \\frac{N_{w|ns} + \\alpha}{N_{ns} + \\alpha V}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $m$ be a message (not necessariy in the corpus) made of a succession of $n$ words $w_1$, $w_2$, ..., $w_n$. \n",
    "We define the two weights $p_{m|s}$ and $p_{m|ns}$ by: \n",
    "$$p_{m|s} = \\prod_{i=1}^n p_{w_i|s}$$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$$p_{m|ns} = \\prod_{i=1}^n p_{w_i|ns}.$$\n",
    "(Notice that these definitions are compatible with the above ones if $m$ has xactly one word.)\n",
    "We then estimate the probability $P_{s|m}$ that $m$ is a spam as \n",
    "$$P_{s|m} \\equiv \\frac{p_{m|s} P_s}{p_{m|s} P_s + p_{m|ns} (1-P_s)},$$\n",
    "where $P_s$ is the probability that any message is a spam, and label it as spam if $P_{s|m} > 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\alpha = 0$ and assuming that each word composing $m$ is in the corpus, $P_{s|m}$ would be the probability that $m$ is a spam given by Bayes' theorem starting from a prior $P_s$ and assuming the words are independend of each others. \n",
    "The parameter $\\alpha$ is introduced to account for words missing in spams or non-spams in the corpus. \n",
    "In the follwoing, we will first choose the prior $P_s = 0.5$, minimizing the Shannon entropy. \n",
    "It could be tempting to improve the estimate by choosing a different prior, *i.e.*, taking the ratio of spam messages in the corpus. \n",
    "However, this would increase the dependence of the outcome in the representativity of the corpus. \n",
    "For this reason, in most this project we stick to a prior of $0.5$, althou we will see that taking a different prior seems to improve the results. \n",
    "A different choice of prior would require a careful estimate of the fraction of spam messages in the real world, which is out of the scope of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus we will use is in the text file `SMSSpamCollection`, downloaded from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) on 23 February 2020. \n",
    "It was very slightly alterated (I added a quotation mark at the end of line 5082) to ease the import as a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "It consists of 425 SMS spam messages collected from the Grumbletext website (which seems to be offline at the time of writing (23/02/2020)), 3,375 SMS messages randomly selected from the 10,000 of the NUS SMS Corpus (also offline at the time of writing), 450 SMS ham messages collected from [Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis](https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/253/1/Tagg09PhD.pdf), and 1324 messages from the [SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big](www.esp.uem.es/jmgomez/smsspamcorpus/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first import the Pandas module, which we will use to read and explore the corpus, and the re module to work with regular expressions."
