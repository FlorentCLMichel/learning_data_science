    "# Winning probabilities at the 6/49 lottery game\n",
    "\n",
    "Lotto 6/49, launched on June 12, 1982, was the first Canadian Lottery game to allow players to choose their own numbers. \n",
    "Winning numbers are drawn every Wednesday and Saturday by the Interprovincial Lottery Corporation. \n",
    "Each time, 6 numbers are drawn wthout replacement from a set of 49, plus a bonus number. \n",
    "A player wins money if at least two of the first six are among the numbers they chose. \n",
    "To win the hoghest amount, called the ‘jackpot prize’, a player must have the first six correct numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although most people start playing the lottery for fun, it can also turn into an addiction or some players, with potentially disastrous consequences. \n",
    "One important factor in the development of such addictions is the communication centred on the large amount of money the jackpot prize represents and on the change of life it can entail. \n",
    "This focus on a technically possible but unlikely outcome can overshadow how small its probability is, or, more prosaically, that a player is unlikely to win anything at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this short project, I will estimate some winning likelihoods, in the hope that realizing their smallness may help prevent addiction. \n",
    "I shall mostly use basic Python, in an effort to make the code as transparent as possible, and since the relatively small numbers involved do not require a lot of computing power. \n",
    "I recommend the use of a dedicated library, *e.g.* SciPy, if using the functions defined here on very large integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic combinatorial functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first define two functions: \n",
    "* `factorial`, taking a non-negative integer $n$ and returning $n!$, \n",
    "* `combination`, taking two non-negative integers $n$ and $k$ and returning ${n\\choose k}$."
