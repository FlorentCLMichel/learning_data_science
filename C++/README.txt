The code in NN1.cpp implements a simple neural network wit fully connected layers.
The code in CNN1_cpp.cpp implements a convolutional neural network with softmax activation function. 

Both are made accessible from Python using the boost library. 

The file CNN1_cpp_test.py demonstrates the use of the CNN1_cpp library to build and train a convolutional neural network on the MNIST library.
